WebServe (partial)
==================

This is a partial repository (some bits of it are missing by design currently) of my WebServe project:
 an HTTP(S) 1.1 webserver framework written in C++ in order to:
1. Re-learn about the HTTP protocol.
2. Have a local webserver I completely control in order to host local photo galleries.

It then progressed a bit in terms of supporting more functionality (HTTPS via AWS's S2N library),
and I am using it for hosting some external websites now.
